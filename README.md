Detect pneumonia using transfer learning and Inception V3
## Transfer Learning
So we have all the different models floating around the web. WE have all heard about the Alexnet, VGG, Resnet, Inception and so on. they were all designed to find cats and dogs and toothbrushes, but how many times do we look for that in real life ?

In real life one needs to download a known neural network and use transfer learning to apply it to his/her problem. This generally means to cut of the last fully connected layers at the end and add others that are fit for the problem.

Below please how this transfer learning works:

## Pneumonia Deaths in Children are Primarily in Developing Countries

Pneumonia is an inflammatory condition of the lung affecting primarily the small air sacs known as alveoli. Typically symptoms include some combination of productive or dry cough, chest pain, fever, and trouble breathing. Severity is variable.

Vaccines to prevent certain types of pneumonia are available.Other methods of prevention include handwashing and not smoking.Treatment depends on the underlying cause. Pneumonia believed to be due to bacteria is treated with antibiotics. If the pneumonia is severe, the affected person is generally hospitalized. Oxygen therapy may be used if oxygen levels are low.

Pneumonia affects approximately 450 million people globally (7% of the population) and results in about 4 million deaths per year.

In 2008, pneumonia occurred in approximately 156 million children (151 million in the developing world and 5 million in the developed world).In 2010, it resulted in 1.3 million deaths, or 18% of all deaths in those under five years, of which 95% occurred in the developing world.
