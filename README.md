Detect pneumonia using transfer learning and Inception V3
## Transfer Learning
So we have all the different models floating around the web. WE have all heard about the Alexnet, VGG, Resnet, Inception and so on. they were all designed to find cats and dogs and toothbrushes, but how many times do we look for that in real life ?

In real life one needs to download a known neural network and use transfer learning to apply it to his/her problem. This generally means to cut of the last fully connected layers at the end and add others that are fit for the problem.

Below please how this transfer learning works:
